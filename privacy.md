# Atomic Data - privacy and encryption

Atomic Data is great for sharing, and therefore great as a format for Open Data.
However, Atomic Data can also be used to share secret and private stuff.

## Using Encryption

Encryption turns readable text into gibberish using some specific Key.
The counterpart of that key can be used to _decrypt_ that gibberish, and turn it into its usable form.

TODO!
