# Atomizing: How to create and publish Atomic Data

We call the process of turning data into Atomic Data _Atomizing_.
During this process, we **upgrade the data quality**.
Our information becomes more valuable.
Let's summarize what the advantages are:

- Your data becomes **available on the web** (publicly, if you want it to)
- It can now **link to other data**, an become part of a bigger web of data
- It becomes **strictly typed**, so developers can easily and safely re-use it in their software
- It becomes **easier to understand**, because people can look at the Properties and see what they mean
- It can be **easily converted** into many formats (JSON, Turtle, CSV, XML, more...)

## How to Atomize data

- [Using the **Atomic-Server** app + GUI](./atomicserver/gui.md) (easy, only for direct user input)
- [Using one of the **libraries**](./tooling.md)
- [Using the **API**](./atomicserver/gui.md) (easy, only for direct user input)
- [Create an **importable JSON-AD file**](./create-json-ad.md) (medium, useful if you want to convert existing data)
- [Make your existing service / app **host and serialize Atomic Data**](./interoperability/upgrade.md) (hard, if you want to make your entire app be part of the Atomic Web!)
