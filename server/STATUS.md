# Atomic-Server status & Feature stability

If you're contemplating to use Atomic-Server in a production environment, you'll want to know to what extent you could rely on this project.
Some features are prone to change, whilst others are already fully working as intended.
See [Changelog](../CHANGELOG.md) for a historical overview of (breaking) changes.
This document describes the current status of Atomic-Server, and specifically which features are stable, and which are not.

## Stable

These features are very unlikely to be significantly altered until V1.0. They will also not be dropped.

- HTTP Resource fetching.
- JSON-AD serialization / parsing.
- TLS / HTTPS setup.
- WebSockets. Some features may be added, but for most use cases the current implementation works great.
- Commits. There may be changes in the signature algorithm or the likes, but I don't expect much changes.
- Storage + migration system. Upgrading your Atomic-Server should not lead to data loss. Migrations are fully automated.

## Likely to change

- Endpoint API. Currently only supports GET requests.
- Collections / Queries. Relatively stable, but still lacks some important features (like having multiple filters in one Query).
- Cookie Authentication.
- Document editor, see [milestone](https://github.com/atomicdata-dev/atomic-data-browser/milestone/2).
- Table editor, see [milestone](https://github.com/atomicdata-dev/atomic-data-browser/milestone/3).
- URL requirements for new URLS, see [issue](https://github.com/atomicdata-dev/atomic-server/issues/556)
- Full text search. Improvements to sorting algorithm and adding more filter options is likely.

## Experimental

- Plugin system. All APIs related to this are very likely to change. See [issue](https://github.com/atomicdata-dev/atomic-server/issues/73)
- Chat rooms. They work, but expect serious changes.
