# API

The API of AtomicServer uses _Atomic Data_.

All Atomic Data resources have a unique URL, which van be fetched using HTTP.
Every single Class, Property or Endpoint also is a resource, which means you can visit these in the browser!
This effectively makes most of the API **browsable** and **self-documenting**.

Every individual resource URL can be fetched using a GET request using your favorite HTML tool or library.
You can also simply open every resource in your browser!
If you want some specific representation (e.g. `JSON`), you will need to add an `Accept` header to your request.

```sh
# Fetch as JSON-AD (de facto standard for Atomic Data)
curl -i -H "Accept: application/ad+json" https://atomicdata.dev/properties/shortname
# Fetch as JSON-LD
curl -i -H "Accept: application/ld+json" https://atomicdata.dev/properties/shortname
# Fetch as JSON
curl -i -H "Accept: application/json" https://atomicdata.dev/properties/shortname
# Fetch as Turtle / N3
curl -i -H "Accept: text/turtle" https://atomicdata.dev/properties/shortname
```

## Endpoints

The various [Endpoints](../endpoints.md) in AtomicServer can be seen at `/endpoints` of your local instance.
These include functionality to create changes using `/commits`, query data using `/query`, get `/versions`, or do full-text search queries using `/search`.
Typically, you pass query parameters to these endpoints to specify what you want to do.


<!-- We have a subset of the [API documented using Swagger / OpenAPI](https://editor.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/atomicdata-dev/atomic-server/master/server/openapi.yml). -->

## Libraries or API?

You can use the REST API if you want, but it's recommended to use one of our [libraries](../tooling.md).
