# AtomicServer and its features

[`AtomicServer`](https://github.com/atomicdata-dev/atomic-server/blob/master/server/README.md) is the _reference implementation_ of the Atomic Data Core + Extended specification.
It was developed parallel to this specification, and it served as a testing ground for various ideas (some of which didn't work, and some of which ended up in the spec).

AtomicServer is a real-time headless CMS, graph database server for storing and sharing typed linked data.
It's free, open source (MIT license), and has a ton of features:
