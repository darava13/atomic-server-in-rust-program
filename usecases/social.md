# A decentralized Social Network powered Atomic Data

Instead of only storing posts on twitter, facebook, or some other platform with advertisement incentives, people would store and control their own social media posts, and determine who gets access to which.
Users would get full control over the way they view posts, and how they are ranked.
This means no more advertisements, and therefore no dark incentives to maximize engagement.
